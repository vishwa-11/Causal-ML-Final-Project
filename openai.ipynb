It should be noted that the top or the panty is support and does bind but stays up well. They are a dream to wear and will go with my pants all and nice skirt . They are opaque enough to hide my varicose veins and still be stylish to wear.

Wash up well-possibly have stain release because even red mud washes out without pre treating. Would give 5 stars if the fabric was a little smoother and if they had a button or snap closure (they have a metal hook and eye that won't stay closed in the washing machine.) They come out of the dryer wrinkle-free. Have probably been washed a dozen times already, and holding up very well. They fit him exactly true to size for waist and length, but not baggy in the butt. A straight leg not too wide but wide enough to fit over boot tops. In reality nice enough to wear with a button down shirt out for dinner at a sit down restaurant. Such a good price I would actually give 4.5 stars. Am going to reorder.</s7656>\n",

Sure they are stiff the first couple times worn but simply wash and dry a few times and they are very very comfortable. Wearing a pair of tan dickies originals as I type this, they are the softest most comfortable pair that I own. I will never buy dickies in-store again because they never have my size 33x34 (I'm tall and scrawny) and they lack the variety. Worked in a dairy dept at a grocery store 9yrs through high school and college and I never wore anything but Dickies. Because they last.</s7933>\n",

            "<s11347>I really like the look of these shoes but the quality is lacking. Only after a couple of weeks there were holes where my big toes hit the canvas. I keep my nails short and filed, but he canvas is just really thin. I want to buy another pair, but given the price, it seems it's not worth it as it'll probably last just few more weeks before messing up again. I googled \"toe holes in my keds\" and I noticed this is a problem for a lot of people (try it and see all the pics people have posted). I bought them for $35 at Nordstrom rack and saw another pair recently, so I will try to find a way to add cushion to the front to protect the canvas. If I don't find a suitable solution, I'll be sad to have to give up wearing these.</s11347>\n",

I believe excess padding under the shoe does more harm than good; so I appreciate the minimalist soles on these Sperrys.  I wear a 9.5 3E, but these 9.5 2E do the job. They are a little tight at first, but they loosen up after a while.  I don't know how guys can wear these without socks....just uncomfortable.  Plus your shoes will be less stinky if you wear socks :)</s12178>\n",
